// Decentralized Exchange:  On a smart contract traders can trade tokens - from the smart contract emit an event so
// they can get the data (web front moble)

// After emitting events you can't read them in the past only for entities outside the of the blockchain - not stored as memory 
// events have lower gas cost than  storage
